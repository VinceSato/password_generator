# Your favorite simple password generator

Greetings! This is my first ever public project. The password generator is really simple and straightforward. All the dependencies (basically just using the `random` module) are listed.

## Instructions

First navigate to your prefered folder.
*Optional*: activate your prefered python virtual environment

Head to your terminal, then execute each line as follows:

`git clone https://github.com/VinceSato/password_generator
cd generator
python3 main.py
`

That's it. Hope you enjoy it!
